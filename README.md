# tictactic

I've completed the tictactoe project from here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe

There are a couple of things that I can improve when I come back to this:
1. Add an AI player
2. Fix some of my modules so that they do not use arrow functions for methods.
3. Remove some of the exposed variables/methods since they are unneeded.
4. Overall UI improvements.


Overall I am happy with the project.  Functionally it works as intended.
